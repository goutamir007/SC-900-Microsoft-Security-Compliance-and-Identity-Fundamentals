    1. Notice the information available on the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page.  

1. You may see a blue information box on the top of the page indicating that you may be viewing limited information.  Select **click here**.
    1. To ensure that you get tenant wide visibility, assign yourself the necessary role.  Select **Security Admin** then select **Get access** at the bottom of the page.
    1. You will likely see the message; Root management group dos not exist.  Per the description, the system will create the group for you.  It can take up to 15 minutes to complete (but usually happens faster).  Once the access is granted select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** on the top-left corner of the page, above where it says Get permissions and then refresh the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page.

1. Information on the top of the page includes the number of Azure subscriptions, the number of Assessed resources, the number of active recommendations, and any security alerts.  On the main body of the page there are cards representing Secure score, Regulatory compliance, Insights, Azure Defender, and more.  

1. Select **Recommendations** from the top-left corner of the screen to see the **Active recommendations** and go through them..

1. The recommendations page shows specific actions that can be taken on their potential secure score increase.  Exit the recommendations page by selecting the **X** on top-right corner of the screen.
1. From the main page, select **Regulatory compliance**.
1. The regulatory compliance page provides a list of compliance controls.  Under each control is a set of assessments that are based on the Azure Security Benchmark which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.

#### Task 2: In this task you will navigate to Azure Secure score and explore recommendations that can improve your secure score.

> ‚ùó Important: <br>
> Azure Security Center takes time to populate information such as secure score, compliance, recommendations etc. after enabling the services and enrolling the servers to security center. Sometimes, it can take up to 3 hrs. or even more than that for all the tiles on the overview page to update. if it takes more time, attendees can skip the steps of task 2 & proceed with the Task 3 and can come back later and check on this. We are looking at various approaches to optimize this experience for future workshops.

1. From the Security center overview page, select the **Secure Score** card.

2. From the recommendations page, select **Manage access and permissions**. Notice that there is one item in that group that is red.
3. Select the item **There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription**, which shows the resource health status as red. If selecting selecting this item does not work.
    1. From the top-left corner of the page, select **Security Center**, above where it says Recommendations.    
    1. From the left navigation panel, select **Recommendations**.
    1. From the recommendations page, select **Manage access and permissions**. Notice that there is one item in that group that is red.

5. From the top of the Access control (IAM) page, select **+ Add** then from the drop down select **Add role assignment**.
6. In the Role field, enter **Owner**, then select **Owner** from the list below.
7. From the user list, select **odl_user_XXXXXX@cloudlabsai.com**,(where XXXXXX is the unique ID which provided on the environment page) then select **Save** on the bottom of the page.
8. It can take up to 24 hours for the status to be updated, after which your secure score will also be updated as all the items in the Manage access and permissions group are satisfied.
9. From the top-left corner of the page, above where is says Azure Pass, select **Security Center** then select **Overview** to return the security center overview page.
10. Keep this page open for the subsequent task.


#### Task 3:  Recall that Security center is offered in two modes: Azure Defender OFF (free) and Azure Defender ON. In this task you discover how to enable and disable Azure Defender.


1.	From the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page, select the **Environment settings** from the left navigation panel.
1. Select the greater-than **>**sign next to where is say Tenant Root Group to expand it (do not select Tenant Root Group directly as that will direct you to a different page), then select **Azure Pass - Sponsorship**
1.	On the Defender plans page, notice how you can select Enable all or select individual Defender plans. Leave the settings as they are with all plans set to off.
1.	You can now close the browser tab to exit the Azure portal.
